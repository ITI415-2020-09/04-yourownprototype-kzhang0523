# OwnPrototype
 
#It took me awhile to come up with an idea that was not too simple but also not too hard to code within my abilities. I created a very simple soccer-like game where you, the player are a blue ball and you are pushing the red ball to the goal while avoiding the moving "goalies". I used a timer as a way of tracking highscore so the timer stops when you reach the goal. I couldn't figure out how to restart the game once you've reached the goal and my Highscore doesn't seem to work properly so I think that is my next step to improving the game.
I created slopes on the side of the walls because I noticed that the red ball could get stuck against the wall if you accidentally pushed it to onto the side walls. This way, if the red ball is pushed onto the side wall, you can somehow slide it back out. I added columns from the asset store and overall prefer a simple design for a simple game.
