#It took me awhile to come up with an idea that was not too simple but also not too hard to code within my abilities. I created a very simple soccer-like game where you, the player are a blue ball and you are pushing the red ball to the goal while avoiding the moving "goalies". I used a timer as a way of tracking highscore so the timer stops when you reach the goal.
